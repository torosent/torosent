## Engineering Manager README

This document outlines my core values, expectations, and management approach. My goal is to foster a supportive, high-performing, and creative team environment for meaningful work. These principles are informed by my values, industry research, and insights from other managers.

### Core Values and Management Approach

1. **Focus on Results**  
   I prioritize clear, measurable outcomes over tradition or process for its own sake. Understanding the "why" behind our work helps us assess its true impact.

2. **Support for Autonomy**  
   I trust team members as experts in their domains. My role is to provide clear goals, context, resources, and space for focused work. I take a hands-off approach but offer direct guidance when needed or requested.

3. **Trust and Open Communication**  
   I aim to create an environment where ideas and concerns can be shared freely. I assume disagreements arise from misunderstandings, not malice, and encourage communication in this spirit. Be direct and factual with surfacing problems with potential solutions or a willingness to brainstorm.

   - **Feedback to Me:** Be straightforward, specific, and provide actionable suggestions.
   - **Direct Access:** If you have a question or issue, reach out to me without hesitation.

4. **Accountability and Reliability**  
   Autonomy must be balanced with personal responsibility. Being dependable maintains our standards and supports a healthy work environment. I take commitments seriously and expect the same, though I understand legitimate obstacles may arise.

5. **Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing**  
   Siloed knowledge creates bottlenecks. I encourage teamwork and open sharing of expertise to drive better outcomes, avoiding over-centralization or micromanagement.

6. **Minimizing Unnecessary Stress**  
   Overwork stifles creativity, which is critical in our field. I advocate for practices like regular releases and automated testing to maintain stability and protect time for innovative thinking.

7. **Honesty and Authenticity**  
   I value clear, genuine communication. Since perceptions of directness vary, I encourage discussing feedback preferences with colleagues to ensure clarity and respect.

8. **Valuing People**  
   Team members are the company’s greatest asset. When supported and fulfilled, they deliver exceptional work, which benefits customers.

9. **Action Over Words**  
   I respect those who turn ideas into tangible results. Demonstrating commitment through actions shows dedication and competence.

10. **Team Contribution and Everyday Leadership**  
    I admire those who proactively help and inspire others, regardless of title. Positive change requires collective effort, not waiting for solutions to emerge.

11. **Self-Driven Growth**  
    Engineers shape their own development. I value those who seek learning opportunities and solve problems independently over those who wait for direction.
